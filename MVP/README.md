# Smart contract with QRC20 IOU token for Pool of Stake MVP (backend) designed for QTUM testnet

For trying it these are the details:

First of all, you need a qtum core wallet, you can download it here: https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases

Second you need to run it with the `-testnet` extension.

Than you need some qtum and you can obtain them here: http://testnet-faucet.qtum.info/#!/

And finally here you are our smart contract details:

TOKEN QTUM_PSK_MVP (PQM):
Smart Contract address:

qMaNLQCp86karfym3KE4FJPFoBF8x4brVE (base58)

2c103bcc035e7c7bcad867f5c00cbf07b02d0cd9 (hexadecimal)

NOTES:

1) to send your qtum to the contract to obtain the PQM tokens, you have to use the "sent to" function on the "Smart Contracts" tab
2) to view your PQM balance, you have to add the contract in the "QRC Tokens" tab using the exadecimal address of our smart contract
3) to get some qtum back, you have to send some PQM tokens back to our contract address using the send function on the "QRC Tokens" tab
4) in QTUM network in some case you have to use the "base58" address, in others the "exadecimal" address.
5) QTUM coin and our token has 8 decimals, so if you read 100000000 is equal to 1.

Here you can find a PSK example address for our MVP:
