`Pool of Stake` (PSK) is a first of its kind, decentralized pool for Proof of Stake, the future
of blockchain. Qtum, BOScoin, Tezos and other PoS coin holders can unite in the Pool of Stake
and start Mining 2.0, generating daily forging rewards by simply staking their PoS coins.
PSK is a fully decentralized, self-regulated and completely trustless pool. This is made possible
by powerful use of Smart Contracts and globally distributed nodes. PSK makes Mining 2.0 more
secure and more profitable for individual PoS coin holders. The main goal of PSK is to increase
profits for small miners who unite in the Pool of Stake. For this purpose, an ERC-20 PSK utility
token and an IOU token are used, ensuring that PSK members are always in full control of their
staked coins. The PSK platform will provide an analytics tool via a smart i.o. database that will
allow PSK members to track, control and optimize their investments in a fully trustless way.
